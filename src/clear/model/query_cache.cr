# The Clear::Model::QueryCache
# is a __fire-and-forget__ cache used when caching associations and preventing N+1 queries anti-pattern.

# This is not a global cache: One cache instance exists per collection, and the cache
# disappear at the same time the Collection is unreferenced.
#
# Each cache can references multiples relations at the same time.
# This cache use an underlying hash to access to the references keys.
