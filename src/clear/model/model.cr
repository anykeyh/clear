    # This is a tricky method which is overriden by inherited models.
    #
    # The problem is usage of static array initialisation under `finalize` macro; they are initialized
    # AFTER the main code is executed, preventing it to work properly.
    #
    # The strategy here is to execute the static array initialization under a method and execute this method
    # before main.
    #
    # Then to redefine this method in the finalize block. The current behavior seems to be a crystal compiler bug
    # and should be fixed in near future.
